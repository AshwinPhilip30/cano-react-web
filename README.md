## Instructions

- Clone the repository locally
- Create a new branch called `your-name-dd-mm`
- Complete the tasks listed below
- Push to origin on your new branch

## Tasks

1. Make alternating rows different colors.
2. Implement the `removeItem` function to the app. The function already exists as an action and is already imported in the `List` component. All that's left is to implement the reducer and call the function in the component while also adding a button.
